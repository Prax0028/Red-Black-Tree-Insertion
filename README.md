# Red-Black-Tree-Insertion
Red-Black Tree Insertion Along With Postorder Traversal and BlackHeight of Tree

The Red-Black Tree Insertion codes I found online didn't work to fit my constraints. They would give segmentation faults or would order the nodes wrongly.
This is in case anyone else faces the same problems. Hopefully this works for everyone.
